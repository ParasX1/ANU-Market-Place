## Agenda Items
| Number | Item |
| :--- | ---: |
| [1] | [Classes] |
| [2] | [UML Diagram] |
| [3] | [Finalising App Goal] |
| [4] | [Finalising App Features] |

## Meeting Contributions:
- Final Idea: (ANU Marketplace) : Social platform for exchanging goods and services which is intended for use by all ANU students/staff.
- Features:
- - 1 Hard Feature:
    Provide users with the ability to message each other or an institution directly (e.g., a user can message an event/movement that is managed by another user). (hard)
- - 3 Medium Features:
    Provide users with the ability to ‘block’ users. Preventing them from directly messaging them. (medium)

    Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app (this item replaces the requirement to retrieve data from a local file) (medium)

    The ability to send notifications based on different types of interactions (posts, likes follows, abuse reports, etc). A notification must be sent only after a predetermined number of interactions are set (>= 2 interactions [e.g., one like and one follow or two likes or two follows]). Note that it is not mandatory to use the Android Notification classes. (medium)
- - 5 Easy Features:
    Use Firebase to implement user Authentication/Authorisation. (easy)

    The ability to micro-interact with items in your app (e.g. like/dislike/support/report a post/message/event) [stored in-memory]. (easy)

    Process visualisation. Your app may implement a graphical element to visualise the progress of a process/event. (easy)

    UI must have portrait and landscape layout variants as well as support for different screen sizes. Simply using Android studio's automated support for orientation and screen sizes and or creating support without effort to make them look reasonable will net you zero marks. (easy)

    User profile activity containing a media file (image, animation (e.g. gif), video). (easy)

- - Classes:
- - User Class: (Object of user holds (uID, Full name)) (Get/Set Methods) 
- - Listing Class: (Each listing: (key, name, price, catagory, pictures id))
- -
