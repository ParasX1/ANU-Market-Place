# PineAPPLE Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* *Try to summarise and list the `bullet points` of your project as many as possible rather than give long, tedious paragraphs that mix up everything together.*

* *Try to create `diagrams` instead of text descriptions, which are more straightforward and explanatory.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report.*

*Please remove the instructions or examples in `italic` in your final report.*

## Basic Description and Features Of Our App
Our App:
  ANU Marketplace: A place to buy sell used goods in a safe ANU community.

Why we chose this app to develop:
  Students these days are quite burdened financially by many aspects of life, ranging from moving out and working to Uni fees, all causing lots of stress. As the goal of this group project was to develop a app that does "Social Good", we chose to tackle this problem faced by many students at the ANU. As such we came up with a idea of a app which would allow students of the ANU to form a close community who would buy and sell used goods. This app would be called "ANU Marketplace". We thought limiting the app to ANU students for the time being would eliminate forms of trolling/scamming as to sign up to the app it will be requiring your studnent UID number. As such if any "bad behaviour" was to occur it can be brought to ANUs eyes and dealt with, resulting in a very safe buying and selling enviroment. To accomplish this goal of a "Market place" we would have to complete the key functionality of which a student has the ability to post ads with pictures, have a way to contact them, have a secure application using validification to make sure no one can steal protected information, and the ability to have a cool customisable profile. As such we chose our "feature goals" as follows:

- - 1 Hard Feature:
    Provide users with the ability to message each other or an institution directly (e.g., a user can message an event/movement that is managed by another user). (hard) (Done: Paras)

    Using Firebase or another remote database to store user information and having the app updated as the remote database is updated without restarting the application. E.g. User A makes a transfer, user B on a separate instance of the application sees user Aâ€™s transfer appear on their app instance without restarting their application. (very hard) (Chat, Posts Updates Automatic,refresh on pull)

- - 3 Medium Features:
    Search functionality can handle partially valid and invalid search queries. (medium) (Done: Alan)

    Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app (this item replaces the requirement to retrieve data from a local file) (medium) (Done: Paras,Alan,Raed,Raymond)

    The ability to send notifications based on different types of interactions (posts, likes follows, abuse reports, etc). A notification must be sent only after a predetermined number of interactions are set (>= 2 interactions [e.g., one like and one follow or two likes or two follows]). Note that it is not mandatory to use the Android Notification classes. (medium)  (Done - save posts : Raed/Raymond)
- - 5 Easy Features:
    Use Firebase to implement user Authentication/Authorisation. (easy) (Done:Paras)

    The ability to micro-interact with items in your app (e.g. like/dislike/support/report a post/message/event) [stored in-memory]. (easy) (Raymond)

    Process visualisation. Your app may implement a graphical element to visualise the progress of a process/event. (easy) (Done:Paras, Raed)

    UI must have portrait and landscape layout variants as well as support for different screen sizes. Simply using Android studio's automated support for orientation and screen sizes and or creating support without effort to make them look reasonable will net you zero marks. (easy) (Semi Done: Paras,Raed)

    User profile activity containing a media file (image, animation (e.g. gif), video). (easy) (Done:Raed,Paras)

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

The conflict resolution protocal was voting, we all would take turns in verbally explaining reasoning for what we should do, and why we should do it. Overall this was a effective method of resolving conflicts, we did not have many, but a example of effective conflict resolution was when we decided to use AVL tree for searching in comparison, the reasons for it was easy to understand (we have done it in lab), and was self balancing hence reducing code, as we would not need to write rebalancing code for the tree. The reason against was that it was slightly slower. With a vote, we decided for the positive reasons we should do a AVLtree. Another example was what way shall we construct the User factory class, as this class was responsible for creating/ storing important information to the database, as such we planned out and saw what requirements we all had for each of our parts and then after we combined/adapted it.

Following the method above we were able to resolve all conflicts effectively, and without any problems.

*[Write a well defined protocol your team can use to handle conflicts. That is, if your group has problems, what is the procedure for reaching consensus or solving a problem? (If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*





## Application Description

ANU Marketplace as mentioned above is a media application, directly targetting all students/staff of ANU who are in need of 2nd hand goods. It provides a safe ANU only enviroment in which any student, even those who are new to Australia (International Students) a place to buy/sell 2nd hand goods. In other buy/sell applications there is a large threat of unsecure transactions, scams and even trolling, by restricting the user base to just ANU we can minimise all these problems, as registration of a user requires a UID, Full Name and Email.

Example Use Cases:
1.  
2.

2. *She makes a post about... with the tag...*
3. *Lachlan, a vet, writes a reply to Molly's post...*
4. ...
5. *Molly gives Lachlan's reply a 'tick' response*

## Application Design and Decisions

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*

   * *Objective: It is used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*

   * *Locations: line xxx in XXX.java, ..., etc.*

   * *Reasons:*

     * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*

     * *We don't need to access the item by index for this feature*

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

*[Where are the known errors and bugs? What consequences might they lead to?]*

*Here is an example:*

1. *Bug 1:*
- *During signup the UID can be manipulated, in a non acceptable way, if you fill out the registration fast enough it will allow non-acceptable variations such as u2093092, or -320433, a basic password check function has been implmented*
- Consequence: Results in problematic user profiles, and possible errors in creation of chat rooms ids. 

2. *Bug 2:*
- *When messaging another user, the other users profile pic wont show up at the top of the chat, possibly due to a variable misnamed, which could not be pinpointed*
- Consequence: Results in possible error to talking to the wrong friend, however the name of the friend is also displayed, so the impact is low. As such the error is mostly cosmetic.

3. *Bug 3:*
- *When searching in activity 2, for posts, the signout button floats to the top, was a easy fix we missed. Only was missing a constraint*
- Consequence: Accidental signout is possible while typing, possible frustration. Overall minimal effect.

4. *Bug 4:*
- *Search search works only from the left????*  - ALAN TALK ABOUT THIS ERROR
- Consequence: Results in possible error to talking to the wrong friend, however the name of the friend is also displayed, so the impact is low. As such the error is mostly cosmetic.

5. *Bug 5:*
- *No search function to chat to your friend.There is no search function, as such its very dificult to find user to message who owns the post*
- Consequence: Possible frustration, however in the post the uID of the postee is mentioned, as such emailing is still possible.

6. *Bug 6:*
- *To chat to your friend, there is no search function, as such its very dificult to find user to message who owns the post*
- Consequence: Possible frustration, however in the post the uID of the postee is mentioned, as such emailing is still possible.

*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team does not know of, it shows that your testing is not thorough.*
